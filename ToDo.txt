Modifications in next version:
1. restructuring of the program so that:
1.1 clean up the boundary detection loop so that projection returns a space which is neatly trimmed to size of one image and spaces for every image are summed to create the final space.
1.2 separate the classes and make them usable independently so you can use functionality of the program without a specfile structured input.
1.3 make a separate and easy modified specialization class so that it is easy to input new projections, new hutches new types of scans without making the diversification murky
1.4 Move into seperate files
1.5 Improved structure for adding scanbases
2. better theta correction for both theta directions
3....
